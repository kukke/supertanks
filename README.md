This will be a game.

## Getting Started

Run `npm install` to install the dev environment.

Run `num build` to build the typescript files.

Run `npm start` to start the local webserver, serving from the `dist` folder.

Run `npm startwatch` to start the local webserver, and watch for changes in any ts files. When a ts file is changed, it is automatically built, so you just have to refresh the browser to see the changes.
